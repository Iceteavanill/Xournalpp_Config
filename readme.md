# Info 

This repository is my current configuration for [Xournal++](https://github.com/xournalpp/xournalpp)

## where

If you want to try them yourself you can find the file locations [here](https://xournalpp.github.io/guide/file-locations/)

# content

Notable settings:

## toolbar setup

![Toolbar](images/Toolbar.png)

## touch scrolling

![touch scrolling](images/touch%20scrolling.png)

Touch scrolling has never worked for me or anyone I know that uses xournal++. So I disabled it
