# Info 

This repository is my current configuration for [Xournal++](https://github.com/xournalpp/xournalpp)

It is ment as a reference for a quick setup.
The primary use case is note-taking during lectures.

## Using it yourself

If you want to try this setup yourself you can find the configuration locations [here](https://xournalpp.github.io/guide/file-locations/).
If you copy and paste the contents of this repo (excluding the readme) into your config folder, you will use this config (after a restart).

## Needed adjustments

This config was made for a Surface Pro 8. 
If you use a different Laptop, you might have to adjust the input devices:

It might take some trial and error.

# Content

Notable settings:

## Toolbars

horizontal toolbar:

portrait toolbar:

## Touch scrolling

Touch scrolling has never worked for me or anyone I know that uses Xournal++. So I disabled it.

## Page templates

In the folder templates there are 2 darkmode page templates I currently use.
You import them this way:

# Caveats

I noticed the following things while using Xournal++.
These are not dealbreaker, however it is nice to be aware of the limitations:
 - Zooming to far into a PDF is not a good idea. It results in long loading times. Most time however it manages to recover and you don't lose any progress. 
 - Xournal++ also does not like annotating very long PDF's (100+ pages). It might need some more patience compared when using it normally.
 - Colours and styles are applied for each tool separate.
 - The latex input is not very helpful for finding a mistake in a formula. It is best to write the formula somewhere else and then copy and paste the code.

 All in all I do not regret switching from OneNote to Xournal++ and can recommend it.
